d-nanomsg
============

summary: nanomsg bindings for the D language.

The bindings are in the nanomsg.di file. The other files are
just for testing and demonstration of the binding. The files
nanocli.d and nanoserv.d implement a basic NN_PAIR of client
and server that send and receive in lockstep.
